#The Drink Predictor

A Streamlit web application that uses a machine learning model to predict total pure alcohol consumption based on servings of beer, spirits, and wine.

##About the Project

This project provides an interactive tool for exploring the relationship between different types of alcohol servings and total pure alcohol intake. The application is powered by a Linear Regression model trained on a publicly available dataset. It demonstrates a simple yet effective way to deploy a machine learning model for a real-world use case.

##Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

##Prerequisites
You need to have Python installed on your system. It is recommended to use Python 3.6 or a more recent version.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1.  Make sure you are in the project's root directory.
2.  Run the Streamlit application from your terminal:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3.  Your default web browser will open a new tab with the application. You can now use the sliders to input the serving data and get a prediction.
