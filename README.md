The Drink Predictor
A Streamlit web application that uses a machine learning model to predict total pure alcohol consumption based on servings of beer, spirits, and wine.

About the Project
This project provides an interactive tool for exploring the relationship between different types of alcohol servings and total pure alcohol intake. The application is powered by a Linear Regression model trained on a publicly available dataset. It demonstrates a simple yet effective way to deploy a machine learning model for a real-world use case.
